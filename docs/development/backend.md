# Backend Info

Backend service is the core of the application which executes the commands given from the UI via API's and additionally hosts UI build

- Path: `packages/backend`

## Tooling

- **Vite**: to do unit tests
- **Typescript**: to transpile Typescript code to JS
- **ESLint**: for linting codebase


## Core Packages used

- **SQLite** & **Knex**: for storing and managing Zombienet template and network executions info in `sqlite` DB
- **Express**: for proving HTTP API's

## HTTP API's

### Health API

- `/healthz/`
  - This API will return the status of the larch service

### Version API
- `/api/larch/version/`
  - This API will return the zombienet version and larch version respectively

## Network APIs

- **Create Network API**: `/api/larch/network/create`
  - This is a POST API. This will use to create a new network. This will return the Network name and the Run ID respectively. This Run ID will use to see the Network Running Output.
- **Check Network Status API**: `/api/larch/network/status/`
  - This is a GET API. This will use to check the network status of a particular network. This API will take networkName as a parameter (?networkName=ATestNetwork).
- **Display Network Info API**: `/api/larch/network/`
  - This is a GET API. This is used to display the network information like network name, network ID, configuration file name, configuration file, network directory, network provider name, network status, testing zndsl file, test file name and network creation time.
- **Test Network API**: `/api/larch/network/test/`
  - This GET API takes network name as a parameter and run the network test with the given dsl test file and will return a Run ID.
- **Display Network Run Output API**: `/api/larch/network/run`
  - After network creation or network testing there lots of process to which we need to keep an eye on. For tracking those output this GET API is used. It will take the run ID as input and show the result on the output.
- **Update Network API**: `/api/larch/network/update/`
  - This is a POST API. To update the configuration file and network directory path and network provider we can use this API.
- **Delete Network API**: `/api/larch/network/update/`
  - To delete a particular network we can use this API. In this case we can pass the network name as a parameter.
- **Listing API**: `/api/larch/network/list/`
  - This is a POST API. We can list out network by network name, configuration file name, network provider, network test file name.
- **Network Run List API**: `/api/larch/network/run-list/`
  - We can also List out network output by their Run ID, intension or command.

## Template APIs

- **Create Template**: `/api/larch/template/create/`
  - This API is for creating a network template, with the relevant network configurations (network name, network ID, configuration file name, configuration file, network directory, network provider name, network status, testing zndsl file, test file name). User can use this template in future. This API returns a template id as response.
- **Get Template Details**: `/api/larch/template/`
  - This API is used to get the existing network templates. By passing the template id we can get that particular template details.
- **Update Template**: `/api/larch/template/update/`
  - This is a POST API. To update the configuration file and network directory path and network provider we can use this API.
- **List Template**: `/api/larch/template/list/`
  - This is a POST API. We can list out network template by network name, configuration file name, network test file name.
- **Clone Template**: `/api/larch/template/clone/`
  - To copy the template this api can be used.
- **Delete Template**: `/api/larch/template/delete/`
  - To delete a particular Template we can use this API. In this case we can pass the template id as a parameter.

## User Operation APIs

- **Get User Operation**: `/api/larch/user_operation/`
  - To get the all the operations done by the user this API is used.
- **Purge User Operation**: `/api/larch/user_operation/purge/`
  - This is a GET API. To remove all the user operations this API is used.
- **User Operation List**: `/api/larch/user_operation/list/`
  - To get all the user operation list filter by operation and operationDetail.


## Some notable functionalities

### Network Status Update

During the network creation process, three network states might occur: creating, running and failed. At the time of creating a network the network state will be 'creating', if the network is created successfully, it will be in the running state, if any problem occurs during the network creation process the network state will be 'failed'. In this case, we have to keep updating the network_state column from the database to get the latest state.  So we use a corn job to update the network after each second. We can get the current network status from `/api/larch/network/status/` API.

- `startInterval()`:
  - The startInterval function is acting as a corn job which is updating the network state for the existing network in each second.

### Delete Network

Delete network function is used to `delete` a network from the created network list. It will update the network state to `in-cleanup` and also delete the network directory from the process. At last it deletes all the network run information from the database.

### Create Network

create network function is used to `create` and `run` a new network. The required network information (NetworkInfo) is passed as parameter. In this process it inserts all the network information into the database and creates a directory as the network name under the network directory. If the testFilename and test config file is given by the user the it will create the directory under the network directory as the test file name convert it to zndsl file from a `base64` file.
