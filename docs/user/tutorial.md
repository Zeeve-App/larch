# Tutorial

This tutorial will consist of creating template and network from the created template, this tutorial is to reproduce the official Zombienet example: [zombienet/examples/0001-small-network.toml at main · paritytech/zombienet · GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/blob/main/examples/0001-small-network.toml)

**Disclaimer**: This setup is for linux systems, and if you are trying to replicate the process on Mac then follow Mac instructions mentioned in [Larch Prerequisites](../../readme.md#prerequisites) section, Mac is not officially supported right now, but if Podman emulation works then Larch will be able to orchestrate network, and K8 execution on remote Linux cluster with `kubectl` setup on Mac should also work.

1. Download the larch binary from [releases](https://github.com/Zeeve-App/larch/releases) or [build](../development/binary_build.md) it yourself:
2. Install Podman / kubectl (as described in here - https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet#with-kubernetes) on the system to orchestrate the Zombienet networks.
3. Give execute permissions to larch binary: `chmod 755 larch`, Run the larch binary by doing: `./larch`
4. Open `http://localhost:9000` in the browser
5. Click on `Network Template +` button, present at the top of page
6. Name the template: `sample-template`
    - Select either `Podman` or `Kubernetes` as **Provider** based on your preference (the provider should be installed as mentioned in prerequisite - [Larch Prerequisites](../../readme.md#prerequisites))
    - click `next` at the bottom of the page
7. We are in `Relaychain Configuration` section, Some of the fields are prefilled, now in the `Nodes` sub sections, 
    - add value `alice` in the `name` field, select `validator` option, click `+` icon button present inside the `Nodes` sub section, this will add new node input section.
    - In the new node box, add value `bob` in the `name` field, select `validator` option.
    - Basically we added two nodes with validator enabled, now click next
8. Now we are in `Parachain Configuration` section
    - click on `+` icon button to add new parachain config.
    - set Parachain ID as `100`, (it can be any number)
    - set collator name as `collator01` and collator command: `polkadot-parachain`
    - now click on next
9. We can skip HRMP for this tutorial so we select next
10. Now we are in Test configuration section
    - the configuration will have description and network field prefilled (from network name)
    - append the given configuration below the existing config.
11. Click on save to save the template
12. Now template will be visible in Templates page, now click on create button to create network for evaluation
    - A dialog box will open, in this add network name and click confirm to start the network orchestration process.
    - Loader will start once the process is started application will redirect to networks page, and it would be in creating state
13. To view the command and execution logs, click on eye icon, this will redirect to executions page with network name filtered
    - To view command, click on command button this will open a modal with the command and other metadata
    - To view logs/output, click on output button this will open a modal with the standard and error stream output along with other metadata
14. The preceding step conclude the network creation.
